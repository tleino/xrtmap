xrtmap - real time point plotting on a map for X11

Dependencies
============

- libpng
- X11

Build & Install
===============

./configure ~
make install

Caveats
=======

By default xrtmap supports background image that is exactly 720x360.
You should use equirectangular projection world map (a.k.a. equidistant
cylindrical).

Usage
=====

Pipe a data stream that contains latitude, longitude data to xrtmap
and xrtmap will display them on the map for n seconds.

$ cat | xrtmap
0.0 0.0
10.0 10.0
20.0 20.0

Also see example.sh which you could run e.g. like this on OpenBSD:

$ doas ./example.sh | xrtmap
